## lm

This project is a POC lm/LogManager replacement in pure Rust, redirecting logs to binary files on the SD card, inside `/lm-rs`.

Note that this implementation of the LogManager process is far from replicating the actual process, since it's just more like an example of what can be done with this organization's tools.

## lmviewer

`lmviewer` is a simple command-line tool to parse binary logs generated by this LogManager replacement.

It takes a directory (presumably containing several log files generated in-console, named with a hex number representing the system tick value when the log was saved - `0x*.bin`).

The format is quite relevant here, as lmviewer will sort the log files according their name so they are printed in the same order they were logged.

### Optional arguments:

- `-v` / `.--verbose` : [**Unimplemented yet**] Show all the information for each log packet (by default only the log string gets printed)
