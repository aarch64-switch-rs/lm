# lm

This is a lm (LogManager) replacement/reimplementation in pure Rust, redirecting logs to binary files on the SD card (inside `/lm-rs`)

## lmviewer

`lmviewer` is a simple command-line tool to parse binary logs generated by this LogManager replacement.

It takes a directory (presumably containing several log files generated in-console, named with a hex number representing the system tick value when the log was saved - `0x*.bin`).

The format is quite relevant here, as lmviewer will sort the log files according their name so they are printed in the same order they were logged.

### Optional arguments:

- `-v` / `.--verbose` : [**Unimplemented yet**] Show all the information for each log packet (by default only the log string gets printed)
